# GCPToHUBO
GCPToHUBO is a tool to convert GCP (graph coloring problem) to HUBO (higher-order unconstrained binary optimization). It can also measure the number of qubits, CNOT gates, and T gates for each method when using Grover adaptive search. This project is developed by Yuki Sano, Yokohama National University, Japan.
